        Is the result list created immediately, or when the list is accessed? In Kotlin, it happens
        whichever way you need it to. By default, [filter] is eager, and each time you use the filter, a list is created.

        To make the filter lazy, you can use a [Sequence], which is a collection that can
        only look at one item at a time, starting at the beginning, and going to the end.
        Conveniently, this is exactly the API that a lazy filter needs.
